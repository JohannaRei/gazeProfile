# gazeProfile

Data analysis project for subject level individual profiles for infant eye tracking.
Done at Baba Center, Children's Castle Hospital, Helsinki.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing was done with Infant Cognition Lab's (University of Tampere) [gazeAnalysisLib toolbox](http://www.uta.fi/med/icl/methods/gazeanalysislib.html) for MATLAB.

## Notice
This project is still in development, final version should be out early 2018.

### Comments
The files are at points VERY overly commented, which is bad coding practice on my part. This commenting style is due to learning from experience that (especially in research) even very thorough external documentation may mysteriously disappear along the way during development. Most comments will be gone very soon.
