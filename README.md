# gazeProfile

Data analysis project for subject level individual profiles for infant eye tracking.
Done at Baba Center, Children's Castle Hospital, Helsinki.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing was done with Infant Cognition Lab's [gazeAnalysisLib toolbox](http://www.uta.fi/med/icl/methods/gazeanalysislib.html) for MATLAB.

## Notice
This project is still in development, final version should be out early 2018.

# Comments
The functions are very throroughly commented, which may make the file slightly hard to read and not the prettiest. This commenting style is due to learning from experience that (especially in research) even very thorough external documentation may mysteriously disappear on the way.
